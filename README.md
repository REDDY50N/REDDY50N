Hi there 👋

- 💻 I am working as Qt/C++ Software Engineer at [POLAR Cutting Technologies](https://www.linkedin.com/company/polar-mohr/)
- 🧰 I use daily:  C++, Cmake, Qt, Bash/Shell Script, Linux CLI
- 🔎 Interested in everything related to modern software development and  greenhouse automation
- ❤️ Open Source Software 
- 🐧 Linux ... runs on a vast majority of modern devices

### Projects

Currently I put all my past projects together to a large scale greenhouse data acquisition and monitoring system. This system uses an Arduino programmed in pure C++ with CMake to gather sensor data, which is then processed by a Raspberry Pi acting as the central unit (the brain). The Raspberry Pi manages the database, provides visualization, camera access, and supports web interfaces and dashboards.

I am passionate about developing efficient software in native languages like C++ and Rust. Deeply interested in embedded Linux, find Rugix to be an excellent alternative to the Yocto Project.
